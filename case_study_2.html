			<h1>Design Intent</h1>

			<ul class ="display-desc-list">
				<li><p>To create a prototype of a traditional 2D PVE fighting game. This serves as a mockup for when the game is recreated and polished on a custom engine.</p></li>

			<h1>Constraints</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="display-desc-container">
			<ul class ="display-desc-list">
				<li><p>Time was a strong, primary constraint. While juggling other academic modules, I had to research how to create a fighting game. There were no Unity specific tutorials online on how I would create a pure traditional punch-kick type of game, which meant that I would have to observe and learn through practical experience. This was punishing for me as I had to pick up fast on what was a key feature I needed such as hitstop and the ability to chain moves and output a prototype for my team in just two months. I had to define and design the systems needed from pure visuals and videos, then realize these features in the game. Because of this, I had to be <b>deliberate defining our prototype gameplay scope</b>, <b>focusing on the key mechanics</b> such as attack chaining, and pouring much more of my time into ensuring what would have the biggest impact on feedback loop to ensure a <b>satisfying player experience</b>.</p></li>
